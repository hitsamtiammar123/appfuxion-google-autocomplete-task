# AppFuxion Google map task
Here is my take home test project. I work this mini project based on requirement that given to me. Here is some points of this task:

- This task generated by `create-react-app` without concern on testing
- I run use `craco` command instead of `react-script` in order to enable module aliasing
- I use `@react-google-maps/api` library to generate map and for autocomplete I use `react-google-autocomplete`
- For making code clean and tidy, I use `eslint` and `prettier`
- I implement `sccs` as stylesheet langange
- I seperate every components and utility on folder based on their functionality
- I implement `redux-persist` to store saved place
- The autocomplate have limit only 75,000 request per day
- I implement `redux-thunk` as middleware
